Hi! This is a simple starting point for a HTML5 game using Canvas, Sockets.io and Express.

You'll need Node and NPM. I'm using the NodeJS.org LTS of 10.16.0 and npm 6.9.0.

To start using this, here's what you'll have to do:

* `npm install`
* `npm start`

The start script runs webpack in watch mode, and nodemon, so any changes you make to the client or server directories should cause webpack to rebuild and the server to restart, respectively. Note that you may need to wait a moment for the webpack build to complete - if you refresh the page too soon, you may not see your changes.
